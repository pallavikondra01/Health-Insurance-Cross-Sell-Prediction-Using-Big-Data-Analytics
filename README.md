### **Vehicle Insurance Cross-Selling Project**

#### **Overview**
The Vehicle Insurance Cross-Selling Project leverages advanced big data analytics and machine learning techniques to address the business challenge of identifying potential customers for vehicle insurance among existing health insurance policyholders. The goal is to enhance marketing efficiency, improve customer targeting, and maximize conversion rates.

#### **Key Features**
1. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Utilized machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, to predict customer interest in purchasing vehicle insurance.
   - XGBoost emerged as the best model with an AUC score of 83.63%.
   - Key predictors included Vehicle Damage, Vehicle Age, and Previously Insured status.

2. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Applied K-Means clustering to identify five distinct customer segments, enabling personalized marketing strategies.
   - Segments include Cost-Conscious Customers, Premium Buyers, Risk-Averse Customers, First-Time Buyers, and Loyalists.

3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Explored customer demographics, policy details, and behavioral attributes to uncover actionable insights.
   - Visualized feature relationships and distributions using advanced libraries like Plotly and Bokeh.

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - Addressed significant class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for effective minority class prediction.

5. **Scalable Pipeline**:
   - Built a PySpark-based pipeline to automate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for large-scale datasets.
